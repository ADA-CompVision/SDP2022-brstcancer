# SDP2022-brstcancer
This repository contains the code for the final project of the Senior Design Project at ADA University, for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters. The project is focused on the classification of breast cancer images using various Machine Learning models

The project is divided into the following sections:

data/: contains the dataset used for the project. The dataset is organized into subfolders, each corresponding to a different class. This dataset was obtained from different resources including Kaggle.
notebooks/: contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and model training. These notebooks contain detailed explanations of the code and experiments.
src/: contains the implementation of the CNNs and Transfer Learning models used for classification.
reports/: contains the final report and the presentation slides summarizing the project.
Installation
To use this code, you should first clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ADA-CompVision/SDP2022-brstcancer.git
This code requires the following Python packages:

numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
Usage
You can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data and train the models. The notebooks are self-contained and contain detailed explanations of the code and experiments.

You can also use the code in the src/ directory to train and evaluate the models on your own data. The cnn.py and transfer_learning.py files contain the implementation of the CNN and Transfer Learning models, respectively.
