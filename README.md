Welcome to the main branch of the SDP2022-brstcancer repository!

This repository is a part of the project for the ADA-CompVision course, and it aims to provide a solution for breast cancer classification using deep learning models. In this repository, you will find the following files:

data: a directory that contains the necessary data for training and testing the models.
models: a directory that contains the trained models for breast cancer classification.
notebooks: a directory that contains Jupyter notebooks for training and testing the models, as well as data preprocessing and visualization.
README.md: a file that provides general information about the repository.
To get started, you can explore the notebooks directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to see how the models were trained and tested. You can also explore the models directory to see the performance of the trained models.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. We welcome any feedback that can help us improve our project.

Thank you for visiting our repository, and we hope you find our work useful!
